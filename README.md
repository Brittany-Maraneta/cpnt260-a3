## Helpful Resource to help me

w3Schools helped me reference back to what I learnt with buttons, hovers, and positioning. To search it, I just have w3schools saved and I would go through the css hints and do the try me and adjust on their website first to understand it and then apply it to my website and adjust my classes, colors, etc.
